A discord application should be albe to test the ablilaties of an upcomming moderator, helper or admin. I have made some questions that can be used to test your upcomming staff member

I made this in a google forms, so the questions are formatted for that tho they can be used anywhere

* **Discord tag**  
  _You can use this regular expression to check it is a valid tag `[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,32}#([0-9]{4})`_  
  It is a good idea to know who is applying in your app
* **Discord Id**  
  Pretty simple, you want to make sure your staff member know his or her way around discord, you can easely google how to get a discord id but it is a good test
* **Age**  
  You want to make sure they are over 13 and they are allowed to use disord
* **For how long time have you been using discord?**  
  Are they new or an exprerienced discorder
* **How long can you be online a day?**  
  What can we excpet from the set staff member, I made this a multiple choice question with the awners `1 or less`, `2 - 3 hours`, `4 - 5 hours`, `6 - 7 hours`, `8 - 9 hours` and `10 or more`
* **What is your timezone?**  
  You want your staff to be avaliable 24/7 so if everyone is in the same timezone that is a nono
* **What position are you applying for?**  
  I should not have to explain this one but you just gotta ask
* **Why do you want to applying to this position**   
  What are their motives and goals, I made it so you have to type at least 200 charecters
* **What experience do you have?**  
  _You can list any servers, their member count and what you learned from being staff there_  
  Make this an **optional** question, if you dont have any experiance you dont want to type anything there
* **What will you bring to our community?**  
  _Why should we pick you over anyone else?_
* **Describe yourself as a person**
  _What are your strong and week sides? What hobbies do you have? In what state of your life are you in? (school, university etc)_  
  Who are we working with, what real life experiance do they have?
  
## Scenarios
Scenarios are an important part of an application it tests a staff members abilaties to control and bring a situation to a halt  
I made all the scenarios optional so the user can decide if they want to do them or not, this is a good test for how much they want they job and if they are lazy _like me_  

_We expect the staff of our server to be able to take actions during the tough times of managing a server, here are a few scenarios. Answer as many you like and click next._

_Please read this guide on handling difficult scenarios_

1. Someone is spamming gore in chat, what would you do?
2. Someone is using #General for music commands, the channel ment to do that is named #Music-Commands how would you take action here?
3. You see a administrator abusing their power what do you do and who can you report to? 
4. Two people are trading mild insults in chat how do you approach the situation?
5. Someone has been using a mass dm bot and you get a report about this indecent, how do you gather proof and take actions?
6. You are having a friendly conversation in a voice chat, someone joins in and screams loudly into their microphone what do you do?
7. A few members are having an argument, how would you de-escalate the situation?
8. Someone is mass spamming what would you do? 
9. A member has posted a NSFW image in a non marked channel, how would you handle that?
10. Someone has started doxing the owner in general, posting ips, adresses etc, what would you do?
11. Someone asked you a question (server related) in dms, you don't know the answer what do you tell them?
